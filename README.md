# **Interoperability Data Models (IDM)**

## **Introduction**
The world is transitioning from a centralized  microgrids are becoming essential for sustainable and resilient power systems. However, a significant barrier exists: the lack of standardized attributes across microgrid equipment. Manufacturers often provide datasheets with inconsistent attributes, making it challenging to compare and integrate products from different vendors effectively.

The global energy landscape is undergoing a transformative shift from centralized power distribution systems to decentralized microgrids. With advancements in technology, it is now possible for individuals and communities to become their own utilities. Several factors drive this transition:

<br>**Abundant Energy Resources:** Renewable sources of energy like solar offer sufficient energy density to meet and exceed local energy demands in most cases.<br/>
<br>**Decreasing Euipment Costs:** The prices of solar panels and energy storage systems are steadily declining, making them more accessible.s.<br/>
<br>**Aging Infrastructure:** The existing electrical grids is aging and requires costly maintenance, replacement and upgrades.s.<br/>
<br>**Rising Demand:** Global electricity demand continues to grow driven by decarbonization goals, electrification of transportation and industry and the AI revolution.<br/>
<br>**Need for Resilience:** The existing electrical infrastructure is vulnerable to single points of failure that can cause widespread and rolling blackouts and is prone to cyberattacks<br/>
<br>**Electrification in Developing Countries:** Extending centralized grid infrastructure to remote and rural areas in developing countries is prohibitively expensive. Decentralized microgrids offer a cost-effective and scalable solution to provide electricity access to underserved populations.<br/>

<br>While these external factors are forcing the need for us to rethink how we generate, distribute and consume electricity, one of the main barriers to the widespread adoption of resilient microgrids is the knowledge gap in assessing the interoperability of various microgrid components. The lack of standardized attributes for equipment used in microgrids makes it difficult (expensivie) to perform techno-economic analysis on a system level and compare two products together.<br/>

## **Why This Project Matters**
The Interoperability Data Models (IDM) project aims to harmonize attributes for microgrid equipment, including converters, batteries, circuit breakers, loads, panels, solutions, balance of systems equipment and others. Here's why this initiative is crucial:

<br>**Simplified Comparison:**</br> Standardized attributes enable easier comparison of equipment, helping stakeholders make informed decisions tailored to microgrid applications.<br/>
<br>**Cost Reduction:**</br> By reducing the time and resources needed to gather and interpret disparate data, we lower the overall cost of techno-economic analyses.<br/>
<br>**Enhanced Integration:**</br> Harmonized data facilitates seamless interoperability between different equipment, categories of equipment and manufacturers.<br/>
<br>**Digital Transformation:**</br> Transitioning from static PDFs to a machine-readable JSON format empowers software applications to consume and process data efficiently.<br/>
<br>An example of how these harmonized attributes can revolutionize datasheets is available at **dcide.app/components**.<br/>

## **Background**
The first article of the JSON datamodles was created by Dusan Brhlik and Giel Van den Broeck in 2019 who co-founded by Direct Energy Partners Inernational Corporation (DEP) with a mission to electrify the world at the speed of thought. 
Incosistent equipment attributes made it nearly impossible to asess equipment interoperability. The concepts of describing interoperability and the language around harmonized datasheets and their attributes simply did not exist. The first article of the JSON moodels started as an elaborate spreadsheet and has now been transformed into the world's first digital product catalog with harmonized datasheets at www.dcide.app/components

<br>In order to increase widespread adoption of the attributes, get manufacturer involvement and community engagement, DEP decided to open-soruce this initiateve through the ***Emerge Alliance** https://www.emergealliance.org/<br/>
 to and now championed by Emerge Alliance,

## **Our Vision**
<br>By open-sourcing these data models, we aim to accelerate the adoption of microgrids by lowering access and cost to data in order to simplifying equipment interoperability asessment globally.<br/>

Our vision is for manufacturers to adopt these harmonized data models and release standardized versions of their datasheets using our JSON data format, enabling computers to efficiently process and analyze the information. By embracing these standards, manufacturers can facilitate interoperability, streamline the integration of their products into microgrid systems, and increase adoption of their equipment in renewable energy microgrid systems. This collaborative approach will accelerate the adoption of microgrids, lowering barriers to implementation and simplifying equipment assessment globally.

## **Get Involved**
We welcome contributions from all interested parties. Whether you're a manufacturer looking to adopt these standards or a developer aiming to enhance them, your input is valuable. Together, we can build a more interoperable and efficient energy future.
